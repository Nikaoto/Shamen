# How to play?
**Shamen requires two gamepads to play**
Shamen is a two player action-strategy game about two shamans (shamen if you will) who are taksed
with defeating each other. 

Use the left stick to move your shaman

Use the right stick to move your target around.

Both shamans have four types of totems which can be used with the joystick triggers and bumpers.

**TODO - explain what each totem does**

Each totem stays and applies their efect FOREVER, unless the enemy hits it with their totem to 
destroy it.

* You can stack your totems on top of each other to combo their effects.
* Casting totems drains mana (blue bar in the UI), which slowly regenarates all the time.
* The red bar represents your health.
* When a totem hits you, it breaks, but you take damage. 
* The game works with every type of joystick (generic, ps, xbox...)

# NOTE
I will update the README with more info soon...

# Using
* [DEEP](https://github.com/Nikaoto/DEEP) - my own love2d library to use the Z axis for the 2.5D 
effect. Although, I had to drastically edit it during the jam, because it was malfunctioning.
* [tween.lua](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua) - for timers and interpolation
* [Shack](https://github.com/Ulydev/shack) - for screen shakes
* [Classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic/) - for object orientation in lua
